    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choice 1: Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Is an algorithm very easy to be [understood and interpreted](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html). Able to handle both numerical and categorical data, which would be perfect for the CharityML example since there are many discreet features. It is also computational cheap: the cost of using one is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the other hand, Decision Trees could overfit quite easily. Knowing when to prune it is key. Also, it inclines to have local optimas, since each node will make the best judgement for itself, but can not have a global overview of the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, Decision Trees are good in [scenarios](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-practical-business-uses-of-decision-trees) whether it's needed to increase capacity vs outsourcing to fulfil demand, to purchase cars for company car fleet or to get them on lease\n",
    "deciding on when to launch a new product, deciding on which celebrity to endorse your product.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be a great fit for this problem since it could learn on non-numerical features and generate also a roadmap of decision that could be easily visualized graphically. Also, in my opinion it serves well to naïve assumptions (and probably would highlight ocasions) such as  finding the best type of donor in the least steps, if we consider that anual gain would be the first decision to branch from. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Choice 2: Ensemble Decision Trees (Random Forest)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same scope, [Ensemble's Decision Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) might also be a good choice. It performs well where Decision Trees performs poorly, such as reducing variance without increasing bias, performing well in a [large number of features and a small number of observations](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/widm.1114/abstract). Their weakness, according to [Jeremy Howard](https://www.quora.com/When-is-a-random-forest-a-poor-choice-relative-to-other-algorithms) are\n",
    "\n",
    "> They are very fast to train, but quite slow to create predictions once trained. More accurate ensembles require more trees, which means using the model becomes slower. In most practical situations this approach is fast enough, but there can certainly be situations where run-time performance is important and therefore other approaches would be preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Real world examples](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-interesting-applications-of-classification-algorithms-like-neural-networks-and-random-forests) would be Internet traffic, Video classification, Image classification and Voice classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be a good fit for this problem since it would prevent the pitfalls of Decision Trees, avoiding overfitting, although increasing prediction time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choice 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the data set is composed of people, and people tend to be alike, K-NN would be a good choice. Although it could be used for regression problems, classification scenarios such as this one is often the type of problems the [industry choose to use this algorithm the most](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2014/10/introduction-k-neighbours-algorithm-clustering/). It produces an output easy to interpret, has good calculation time and prediction power.\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires some sort of supervision though: it's needed to define upfront the number of neighbors to use, as well the distance to determine to which class the point would be predicted into.\n",
    "\n",
    "It shows to be very useful in datasets based on location, since a map could be easily represented in a scatter plot and therefore the clustering would be easy to visualize and input into the algorithm. As for this project, it was observed that the data has clusters well defined by income for example, finding nearest neighbors could provide a good prediction."

    "In the code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `'clf_A'`, `'clf_B'`, and `'clf_C'`.\n",
    "  - Use a `'random_state'` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    "  - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Calculate the number of records equal to 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data.\n",
    "  - Store those values in `'samples_1'`, `'samples_10'`, and `'samples_100'` respectively.\n",

That's why there are many algorithms with different characteristics, and that would work the best in different scenarios. For this specific occasion, from those three classifiers suggested, the Random Forest Classifier showed to perform well in the test set, having high accuracy and F-score than the other two, balancing error and performance in time."

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
